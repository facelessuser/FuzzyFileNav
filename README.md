# About
Fuzzy File Nav is a simple plugin that allows for quick navigation of the file system from the quick panel.  It also allows for deletion, copying, moving, and creation of files and folders.

# Usage
Fuzzy File Nav by default has access enabled via the context menu.  You can access the root of your system by selecting ```Fuzzy Nav```.  If you would like access Fuzzy File Nav but have it start in the current direct of the open file, you can select ```Fuzzy Nav Here```.  If you would like to open the bookmark menu with your custom defined folders, you can select ```Fuzzy BookMarks```.

## Suggested Accessibility Shortcuts
You can create shorcuts to access Fuzzy File Nav Quickly, some examples are shown below.

For Windows/Linux:

    [
        { "keys": ["ctrl+o"], "command": "fuzzy_start_from_file" },
        { "keys": ["ctrl+shift+o"], "command": "fuzzy_bookmarks_load" }
    ]

For OSX:

    [
        { "keys": ["super+o"], "command": "fuzzy_start_from_file" },
        { "keys": ["super+shift+o"], "command": "fuzzy_bookmarks_load" }
    ]

## Fuzzy Bookmarks
As mentioned earlier, you can bring up a list of bookmarked folders.  To add or change the bookmark list, simply add/change the entries in the settings file ```fuzzy_file_nav.sublime-settings```. Required parameters are ```name``` and ```path```.

    // Bookmarked paths
    "bookmarks": [
        {"name": "My Computer", "path": ""},
        {"name": "Root", "path": "/"}
    ]

If it is desired to have specific bookmarks show up on a specific OS only or a specific host only, you augment the ```path``` option using the notation below.  For more information, please see **Platform/Computer Specific Settings**.

    // Bookmarked paths
    "bookmarks": [
        {"name": "My Computer", "path": {"#multiconf#": [{"os:windows": ""}]}},
        {"name": "Root", "path": {"#multiconf#": [{"os:linux": "/"}, {"os:osx": "/"}]}}
    ]

## Custom Settings
There are a number of custom settings that can be defined for Fuzzy File Nav in the settings file ```fuzzy_file_nav.sublime-settings```.

    // Location of home folder
    "home": "",

    // Patterns of files/folders to exclude
    "regex_exclude": [".*\\.(DS_Store|svn|git)$"],

    // Keep panel open after a file is opened, deleted, created, etc. so
    // More files can be have actions perfomred on them.
    "keep_panel_open_after_action": true,

    // By default, files hidden by the system are hidden in Fuzzy File Nav
    // as well (files that start with "." in Linux\Unix and files with the
    // hidden attribute in windows)
    "show_system_hidden_files": true,

    // (Unix/Linux only) control whether autocomplete is case sensitive
    "case_sensitive": true,

    // If the "FuzzyStartFromFileCommand" is run outside of a open buffer
    // or from a buffer that does not exist on disk, you can specify
    // its default action to do instead of starting navigation from
    // a file's location.  Options are "bookmarks", "home", "root".
    "start_from_here_default_action": "bookmarks",

Home folder can be accessed any time by typing ```~/``` into the FuzzyFileNav quick panel. Home folder can be configured for multiple OS and/or hosts.  Simply use the notation below and see **Platform/Computer Specific Settings** for more information.

    "home": {"#multiconf#": [{"os:windows": "c:\\Some\\Location"}, {"os:linux": "/Some/Linux/Location"}]},

## Platform/Computer Specific Settings
Currently the ```home``` settings in the settings file, and the ```path``` setting in a bookmark entry can be configured to have multiple OS and/or host specific settings to help manage settings across different machines.

The syntax to configure one of these settings to be OS and/or host specific is found below:

- The setting should be a key/value pair, where the key is ```#multiconf#``` and the value is an array of key/value entries whose keys describe the host and/or os qualifiers needed for the value to be used.
- The key/value entries will have a key that represents one or more qualifiers, each of which must be separated with a ```;```
- Each qualifier consists of the qualifier type and a qualifier value to compare against.  These will be separated by a ```:```.
- There are two supported qualifiers: ```host``` and ```os```.  ```host``` is the name of your PC.  ```os``` is the platform and can be either ```windows```, ```linux```, or ```osx```.
- The key/value entries will have a value associated with the key, and can be of any type: string, number, array, dictionary, etc.

example:

    "home": {"#multiconf#": [{"os:windows": "c:\\Some\\Location"}, {"os:linux": "/Some/Linux/Location"}]},

## Fuzzy File Nav Panel Features
There are a number of featues accessibe by shortcuts when the Fuzzy File Nav Panel is open.  Most shorcuts are combinations of the modifier key ```ctrl```; for OSX simply replace the ```ctrl``` modifier with ```super```.

### Toggle the showing/hiding of hidden files.
```ctrl+h``` Toggle the showing/hiding of hidden files defined by the system or by regex from settings file.

### Show Fuzzy Bookmarks
```ctrl+b``` Show the Fuzzy Nav Bookmarks panel.

### Fuzzy File Name Complete
```tab``` or ```shift+tab``` Complete the file name being typed (shift modifier cycles backwards).  If the current typed name matches one or more file/folders, tab will complete it.  Saddly it cannot tab into the currently selected fuzzy results, but it will tab through close options.

### Navigate Folders
```/``` When you have a completed file name typed, you can type a slash after the name and you will descend into the folder.  Windows can also use ```\``` which will do the same thing.  You can also descend into folders by simply selected them in the nave panel.

### Fuzzy File Delete
```ctrl+d``` Deletes the folder/file object currently typed (full name) in the Fuzzy File Nav panel.

### Fuzzy File Copy
```ctrl+c``` Copies the folder/file object currently typed (full name) file in the Fuzzy File Nav panel.  A Fuzzy File Paste must be performed to complete the copy.

### Fuzzy File Cut
```ctrl+x``` Cuts (moves) the folder/file object currently typed (full name) file in the Fuzzy File Nav panel.  A Fuzzy File Paste must be performed to complete the cut (move).

### Fuzzy File Paste
```ctrl+v``` Completes the copying and pasting of the folder/file object that is in the clipboard.  The file/folder will be pasted into the currently opened folder in the Fuzzy File Nav Panel.  To rename the folder/file object on paste, type the full name that should be used before pressing ```ctrl+v```.

### Fuzzy Make File
```ctrl+n``` Creates a new file in the currently opened folder in the Fuzzy File Nav Panel.  The name that is typed into the panel is the name that will be used.

### Fuzzy Make Folder
```ctrl+shift+n``` Creates a new folder in the currently opened folder in the Fuzzy File Nav Panel.  The name that is typed into the panel is the name that will be used.
